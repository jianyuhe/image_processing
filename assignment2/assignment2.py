    Program Name: SPOT THE BALL -assignment2
    Studnet Name: Jianyu He
    Student Number: D17124591
    Description
     Using opencv techniques to sucessfully crop the ball and Replace the hole suitable color
        project idea:
        I compare 3 image to find what is the similar of balls, 1. ball is biggest white in the image,
        2. ball is circle
        I have 2 ideas for the project
        first idea is I can use inrange function to find white color mask image, then use HoughCircles
        function to find all circle of mask image, after find biggest circle which is location of ball,
        then i can draw the biggest circle on the new black mask image, final I can use inpaint function,
        original image and final mask image to replace the hole which is location of ball.
        
        second idea is I can use houghcicles function to find all circle of original image, then I can use
        x,y and radius to find mini rect of circle to contain circle, after I use img[] to got each rect,
        then use inrange function to create white color mask image for each img[], final I can use loop to
        detect each color of pixel, if the color is white that means img[] contain white circle, as result I
        can find biggest area of rect it contain ball, I can through rect to calculate x, y and radius of ball,
        draw the ball on new black mask image, use inpaint function to fix hole.
        
        I choose first idea for my project.
    
        Implementation:
        First, change color space of original image from bgr to rgb, becasue I will shows image on plt.
        the image is converted to HSV colorspace to prepare for increasing contrast/intensity.
        use inrange function to output mask image which is area of white color, after use erorsion and dilate
        to clean the small noise and fix circle.
        
        then use HoughCircles to find specified circle from mask image, I can know x,y and radius of circle.
        after create a new balck mask image, then draw the specified circle in the black mask image, output the
        final mask image.
        
        final, use inpaint function, origin image and final mask image to replace the circle with suitable color
        
        I use plt to show all of the image
        total 6 image in plt it will be 2*3 form
        
        the results of golf image is not contain all ball so show the final image is not very good, if I want better
        solution I can increase radius of circle.
